# Wiki Racing SPA and API Server

This is the initial REST server, hand-coded and employing techniques and patterns learned from years of building Docker-hosted Go daemons in a
corporate environment. Code review was performed by Gemini, and after the solid aspects of that review were incorporated, Gemini was used to add test
cases. The server is a small [Go](https://go.dev/) binary that can run on any platform supported by Go (including Windows, Linux, macOS) or hosted on
any Docker platform.
