# Wiki Racing SPA and API Server

This is a hand-coded Gleam implementation of the Go language REST server. Gemini advised with the de-coupling of server and client, with removing the 
hard-code use of httpc.dispatch and with code review. Finally Gemini was used to construct the test cases.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
