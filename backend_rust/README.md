# Wiki Racing SPA and API Server

This code was developed entirely by [Google Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/). Since I am not a Rust programmer, I asked the Gemini CLI to build an 
idiomatic Rust equivalent of my Go backend. This is the result. My personal contribution was reviewing the test coverage and asking Gemini to add
test cases that it had missed.
